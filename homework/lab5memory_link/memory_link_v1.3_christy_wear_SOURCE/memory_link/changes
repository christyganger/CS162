bug found - Two copies of each symbol, not randomly picked from the list of 8, and two copies of them.
bug fixed - changed from rand, for assignment, to assign for i to arr[i] .. and arr[8+i] now gives one of each symbol.
bug found = "It’s hard to play when you aren’t shown the first card..."
bug fixed - now shows selected first card face up when selected.
possible bug - "I didn’t find a dynamic array or the delete for it."
possible bug fix- size of array doesnt change.. why dynamic?
text change, "Press Enter, or Return once you've memorized the cards", from any.
bug found = " if same number is picked twice from demo board, gives match, removes from board"
bug fixed = no longer allows same card from demo to be picked for match.
bug found = dynamic array isnt used, for demo nor play field.
bug fixed - removed static arrays from struct t_player, declared as dynamic in main. Passed
changed - functions to match new dynamic arrays
changed - functions to type void, when return isnt needed due to pointer access to heap.
changed - added deletion for both dynamic arrays.
