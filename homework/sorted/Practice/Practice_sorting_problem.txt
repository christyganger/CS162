Practice sorting problem
Create a method that is passed an array and fills it with random numbers between 1 and 99

Create a method that is passed an array and displays it, five numbers per line

Create a method that is passed an array and performs an insertion sort on it

Create a method that is passed an array and performs a selection sort on it

----------

You can start with the Framework for sorting that I provided.  It has the methods described above.  There is a single mySort function, you can replace that with your specific code

---------

When you are done, you can compare your result with my Example Selection and Insertion Sort
